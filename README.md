* for route /register and /login separate GET and POST methods;
* make one query to related tables not several to separate tables;
* add message that there where no matches if nothing was found with a search;
* in search how do I arrange results so that the most matching ones are above;

in templates

* On book page, improve JS notification of review submitting so that after submitting a review for the second time, it gave error message;
* Make yellow stars;
